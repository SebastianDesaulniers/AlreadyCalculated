Hey,
I've tested everything beforehand. It should all work.

Make sure to load the libraries in the libs/ folder, it's different in IntelliJ than in Eclipse, so 

But if something doesn't work, PLEASE do not take off marks.. it would probably be a library error if anything. 

Anyway, enjoy


also, if you don't have a webcam, comment out the call to Webcam, should work then.
